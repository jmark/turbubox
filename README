## Setup, Analysis and Plotting Scripts for the 3D Turbulent Box (Girichidis Stirring)

./quickflash
    This is an older branch, where I did extracting data and analysis in c++,
    resp. quickflash [1].

./pyflash
    Home-brewn python + h5py module with additional scripts for analysis, etc.
    Use this for further research. It is considerably faster and more stable than the
    quickflash branch.

./stirturb.flash.par
    TCL script for calculating and creating a 'flash.par' [2] for the
    Girichidis Stirring Turbulence setup.

./plot
    gnuplot / bash scripts for plotting
