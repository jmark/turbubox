Synopsis
--------
    In this folder there are several scripts for wrangling meaningful data out
    of the checkpoint/plots files produced by FLASH, Flexi and Hopr.

Preparations
------------
    Before using the scripts one has to set $PYTHONPATH appropriately for python3 to 
    find the libraries.

    PROJECT_DIR=<this directory>    
    export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$PROJECT_DIR/lib:$PROJECT_DIR/cython:$PROJECT_DIR/python"

    In case you are working on CHEOPS load following modules:

        if expr "$(hostname)" : '^cheops' > /dev/null
        then
            module load hdf5/1.8.13     2> /dev/null
            module load openmpi         2> /dev/null
            module load python/3.4.3    2> /dev/null
        fi

Directories
-----------
- lib/
- cython/
    Libraries for the toolz in bin/.

- bin/
    - flash2flexi.py [flash file] [mesh file] [flexi file]
        Convert <flash file> to <flexi file> based on the information in <mesh file>.

    - evolution.py < [flash file list] > out.dat
        Loops over given files via stdin and condenses data to global quantities of
        the simulation, like total kinetic energy, etc...

        $ find [path with checkpoint files] -name 'flash_hdf5_chk_*' -type f \
            | sort | ./bin/evolution.py | tee result.dat

    - powerspectrum.*.py [flash file]
        Compute powersectrum of given snapshot.
       
        $ ./bin/powerspectrum.cython.py \
            [path with checkpoint files]/flash_hdf5_chk_... | tee result.dat
