# Synopsis
    Setup, Analysis and Plotting Scripts for the 3D Turbulent Box (Girichidis Stirring)

## quickflash/
    This is an older branch, where I did extracting data and analysis in c++,
    resp. quickflash [1].

## pyflash/
    Home-brewn python + h5py modules/scripts for analysis, etc.  Use this for
    further research. It is considerably faster and more stable than the quickflash
    branch.

## stirturb.flash.par/
    TCL script for calculating and creating a 'flash.par' [2] for the
    Girichidis Stirring Turbulence setup.

## plot/
    gnuplot / bash scripts for plotting

## setup/
    install, compile and run scripts for various platforms
